# secrets-finder
Simple script that searches for secrets (passwords, private keys, tokens, ip addresses, etc) inside any folders that contains source code

```
Usage: ./secrets-finder.sh <DIR1> (<DIR2> <DIR3> ...)
```

Same thing for looking for domain names hardcoded in the source code:

```
Usage: ./infra-finder.sh <DIR1> (<DIR2> <DIR3> ...)
```
